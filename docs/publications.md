### [Overcoming Collaboration Hurdles in High-Tech Product Development with Keysight tool on Azure infrastructure.](https://61dac.conference-program.com/?post_type=page&p=11&id=ETPOST220&sess=sess232)
<br> Description:
The intricate dance of high-tech product development demands seamless synchronization among partners. Miscommunication and data silos threaten deadlines, costs, and, ultimately, product quality. This abstract presents a solution to bridge these collaboration gaps. Current challenges in cross-company projects include unclear design interfaces and inadequate distributed team management. This often leads to fragmented data, hindered handoffs, and inefficient workflows. We propose a secure and scalable platform powered by Keysight technologies that is built on Azure's cloud infrastructure. This platform allows controlled data sharing between partners, fosters real-time communication, and facilitates centralized design data management. Imagine multiple partners seamlessly integrating their diverse tools, methodologies, and strengths through a single platform. Keysight and Microsoft empower "collaborative chambers" where roles are segregated, activities are monitored, and environments are effortlessly scaled or dismantled. The cloud-based model caters to all-in-cloud and hybrid collaboration needs, providing an ideal solution for enterprises and boutique design houses. The future of streamlined high-tech product development is one where collaboration is not a hurdle but a force multiplier for partnering customers.

### [True-Hybrid SaaS Cloud Architectures for EDA Workloads](https://61dac.conference-program.com/?post_type=page&p=11&id=ETPOST221&sess=sess233)
<br> Description
Modern chip development craves the cloud's immense power, but on-premises dependencies hold back a complete migration. This presentation introduces the "True Hybrid" workload model, where design emulation remains on-premises while simulation/verification soars in the cloud. Our approach tackles key challenges: splitting workloads efficiently, streamlining data across environments, and overcoming network bottlenecks. Keysight tools ensure secure, design-aware data exchange, while the AWS platform offers unparalleled security, scalability, and flexibility for high-throughput EDA tasks. Embrace the "True Hybrid" future to unlock the cloud's potential without sacrificing on-premises needs.

## 2024 Invited Industry Expert Speaker at HEP-IC Workshop, BNL
HEP-IC Workshop 2024 is the fourth in a series of workshops designed to bring together US scientists and engineers involved in developing integrated circuit electronics for particle physics and related applications. Participants from US laboratories and Universities will have an opportunity to learn about the latest activities and developments of the various groups, trends in IC design and fabrication, and new technologies that will be needed to enable future scientific goals.  The workshop will also promote collaborations and the exchange of ideas on innovative circuit techniques and provide a forum to discuss new approaches to partnerships and optimize the use of technical resources.  This workshop should provide a high-level overview of activities and opportunities for discussions and exploration of new ideas and partnerships to address the technical challenges posed by the next generation of HEP experiments.
